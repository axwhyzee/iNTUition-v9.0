## ❓ Overview

Our team aims to develop a web application (Jiraji) targeted towards the students in Singapore in improving their experience at managing their groups and streamlining the whole process.

## 💪 Inspiration
All of our group members had similar sentiments that within our NTU life, there were always a small handful of team members who were always disinterested in the group project itself and required additional and it was so tricky to continuously remind them. Fret not, Jiraji is here today to help you solve this problem.

## 🗣️ Solution
Therefore, our group seeks to rely on automation and timely reminders by a Bot to more easily streamline the whole process of managing group projects for their modules.

## What it does
Jiraji is a web application platform for all students to sync their availabilities for easy meeting coordination. It also allows the leader of the groups to add projects, tasks and meetings easily. Once a meeting has been set, a reminder will be sent through Telegram to each member who is included within the project itself.

## How we built it
We built it collectively using the MERN Stack, MongoDB, node.js, Express and React.js.

## 🚀 Challenges we ran into
Since most of the techniques were mostly not taught in school by the professors, we had to quickly adapt and learn as much as we could from online sources such as Stack Overflow, the official documentation, and Youtube itself.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Clean and minimalistic UI for our frontend which did not utilise any templates and all of the code was written by hand by our front-end developers within the team
Being able to perform CRUD operations on the mongo database

## 🚶 What we learned
How to work together as a team and collaborate using Github and Git
New technologies we were unfamiliar with such as React and Express
Using external APIs such as node-telegram-bot-api to perform certain functionalities with our bot

## What's next for Jiraji
Scaling it up to support multiple users
Making sure that the whole application runs smoothly without bugs
Transforming from a web application to a mobile application
